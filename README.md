# fshell
This is a continuation of the Unix-like shell I did in my OS class. I want to add more functionality that makes it more usable.

## Goal

A complete overhaul of my previous sshell, along with additional features from a real shell (e.g. bash or tcsh)

## Features

* Execute programs or commands with arguments
* Change current working directory
* Redirect program input / output
* Pipelining
* Background execution

### Additional Features
* Log and reuse previous commands
* Auto complete

## Building

## Organization

## Conventions
